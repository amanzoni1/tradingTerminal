# Trading Terminal

**Demo trading terminal integrated with Binance, enabling seamless placement of orders (functionality disabled in the live version). This application offers a robust set of tools for traders, including real-time competitive news feeds from multiple sources, dynamic and interactive charting capabilities, highly customizable settings for personalized trading strategies, and comprehensive position tracking to monitor all open and pending orders. Designed to enhance the news trading experience, the terminal leverages three dedicated WebSocket connections to ensure timely and relevant updates, automatically isolating coin symbols from news feeds to facilitate informed trading decisions directly from the news stream. While the live demo showcases the core functionalities and user interface, order placement and execution are disabled to maintain security and protect API keys.**
